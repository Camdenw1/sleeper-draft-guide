"""Fetch free public draft-market, expert, injury, and projection data.

Replaces the old hand-pasted FantasyPros ECR and Flock Fantasy exports, which were
paid products. Everything here is public and needs no account or API key.

  FFC     fantasyfootballcalculator.com -- REAL half-PPR 12-team ADP from public
          mock drafts. This is the only source whose format exactly matches the
          league (half PPR, 12 teams), so it is the anchor.
  ESPN    ESPN's real PPR ADP. Kept as platform context, not included in the
          strict half-PPR market consensus.
  YAHOO   Yahoo's public draft-analysis feed -- average_pick across their drafts,
          where the default league scoring is 0.5/reception.
  RBALLER RotoBaller's free, expert-authored half-PPR overall Top 100. This is
          the expert-opinion lane, not ADP or another projection model.

The lanes stay distinct because ADP, expert rank, and market value answer different
questions. Sleeper supplies injuries and projections, not an official ADP column.
See fetch_mfl for why MyFantasyLeague is out.

Results are cached to pubranks_cache.json (gitignored) so a draft-day rebuild still
works without a network, and so repeated builds don't hammer anyone's API.
